Termite is a generic distributed compilation system.

The master distributes the compilation to workers.  Workers run
arbitrary binaries chrooted in a FUSE mirror of the master's file
system, and then ship the results back to the master.


CAVEATS

Work in progress.  Do not use on machines shared with untrusted users
